        I developed a responsive e-commerce web application using React and React Router, featuring dynamic routing for seamless navigation across product pages, cart, and error handling. Context API manages global cart state, allowing users to add, remove, and adjust item quantities. The app utilizes custom loader functions for asynchronous data fetching, ensuring efficient page load. Tailwind CSS is used for responsive design, including a hamburger menu for smaller screens. The project demonstrates my proficiency in React, React Router, and modern JavaScript practices like asynchronous
        fetching.
